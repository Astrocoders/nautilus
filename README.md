## Getting started

[ReRoute Native website](https://reroute-native.netlify.com/)

### Installation

Open a Terminal in your project's folder and run,

```she
yarn add reroute-native
```

After installation, you will need to add this library to your `bsconfig.json` dependencies

```json
"bs-dependencies": [
  "reason-react",
  "reroute-native"
],
```

In addition you will need to install a few peer dependencies:

```sh
yarn add bs-react-native react-native-gesture-handler
```

* `react-native-gesture-handler` - [installation instructions](https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-gesture-handler#installation)
* `bs-react-native` - `^0.8.0`

As per [this issue](https://github.com/callstack/reroute-native/issues/103), you might need to add the following to your `bsconfig.json`:

```

"package-specs": {
  "module": "commonjs",
  "in-source": true
}

```
This generates output alongside source files. ([documentation](https://bucklescript.github.io/docs/en/build-configuration.html#package-specs))
